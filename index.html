    <h2>Hello World</h2>
    <p>I'm hosted with Github Pages.</p>
    <span>It is nice to be making some progress on my HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript journey!<span>
    
    <br>
    <p>Here is a brief update. While I will continue to work on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, my main focus from today, November 1, 2020 will be on resuming learning Python and completing a textbook on Python within the new month (i.e., November). Also, I will look to try to daily work on my GitHub page for the next 365 days. The same goes for Stack Overflow. This is to enable build some appealing online presence for potential employers in the nearest future.
      Wish me success!
